# Book_Recommendation_KNN
Using the Book-Crossings dataset, containing 1.1M ratings (1-10) for 270K books by 90K users, we'll employ NearestNeighbors from sklearn.neighbors. This builds a model suggesting similar books based on closeness. Our function, get_recommends(book), returns 5 similar books with distances from the input book.
